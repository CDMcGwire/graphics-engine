# Name TBD Engine

A Rust based game engine I'm putting together to learn the art and ecosystem.

This is not intended to become a full-time project or likely to ever release a complete product; it is merely a means for me to learn.

Once I'm confident enough, I will be abandoning this project and likely putting my freetime into contributing to Bevy, which already checks a good chunk of my list for desired game-engine tech/architecture.
